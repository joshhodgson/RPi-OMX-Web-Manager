RPi-OMX-Web-Manager
=====================

A simple HTML and Javascript based OMXPlayer manager, designed with Student TV in mind.

- Allows easy control of Raspberry Pi's (very efficient and powerful media players) to play back VT's
- Displays countdown timers
- Allows "Preloading" of videos (pause videos at 0:00 so they're ready to play immediately)

##To-Do
+ Allow file uploads in browser (and basic file management - renaming, deleting etc)
+ Store data about files (name, length, screencap perhaps?)
+ Enable custom file ordering, and possibly playlists
+ Improve for touch interface
